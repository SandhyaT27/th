    "# Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "__getattribute__ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. __getattr__ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by __getattribute__, but for this __getattribute__ and __getattr__ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, __getattr__ returns a default value. So key difference is that __getattr__ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class.\n",

    "# Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "Python descriptors are created to manage the attributes of different classes which use the object as reference. ... A descriptor is a mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and super();\n",
    "The property() method in Python provides an interface to instance attributes. It encapsulates instance attributes and provides a property.\n",

    "# Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors?\n",
    "The Key Differences:\n",
    "__getattr__: Python will call this method whenever you request an attribute that hasn't already been defined\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__ : This method will invoked before looking at the actual attributes on the object. Means,if we have __getattribute__ method in our class, python invokes this method for every attribute regardless whether it exists or not.\n",
    "Python descriptors are created to manage the attributes of different classes which use the object as reference. ... A descriptor is a mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and super();\n",
