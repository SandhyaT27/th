    "# Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?\n",
    "Metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is itself a instance of Metaclass, and any Instance of Class in Python is an Instance of type metaclass. E.g. Type of of int, str, float, list, tuple and many more is of metaclass type.\n",

    "# Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?\n",
    "In this specific case—adding methods to a class when it's created—the choice between metaclasses and decorators is somewhat arbitrary. Decorators can be used to manage both instances and classes, and they intersect with metaclasses in the second of these roles.\n",

    "# Q4. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling instances?\n",
    "Just like with metaclasses, because the decorator returns the original class, instances are made from it, not from a wrapper object. In fact, instance creation is not intercepted at all. ... Decorators can be used to manage both instances and classes, and they intersect with metaclasses in the second of these roles.\n",
